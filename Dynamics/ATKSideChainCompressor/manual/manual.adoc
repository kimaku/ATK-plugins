*ATKSideChainCompressor* is a free Open Source plugin for stereo track dynamic compression. It features soft to hard knee and colored gain transfert function.

== Usage

Here is how the parameters interact with the plugin:

[square]
* *link* allows to link the two channels together.
* *middleside* switches the stereo channels processing to middle/side.
* *enableCh1* enables channel 1 compressor.
* *enableCh2* enables channel 2 compressor.
* *Dry/Wet* balances the amount of processed signal versus input signal.

Each channel has the following parameters (stereo and middle/side mode):

[square]
* *RMS* changes the size of the window-like RMS computation..
* *Attack* handles the speed at which the attack-release filter increases its detected value.
* *Release* handles the speed at which the attack-release filter decreases its detected value.
* *Threshold* modifies the threshold from which the compressor starts acting.
* *Ratio* modifies the slope of the compression curve. The higher the ratio, the more the compression. Ratios below 1 indicate expansion.
* *Softness* is a comprise between soft knee and hard knee.
* *Quality* is the quality of the knee. The lower the quality, the more extended the color around the knee.
* *Color* is a color scheme near the knee. Positive color raises the output, negative color decreases it.
* *Make-up* Allows to increase the compressor output volume.

When the compressor is in linked mode, there is only one threshold, ratio, softness, quality or color. The other parameters are kept and allow for a compromise between the two channels for the attack release filter (for instance if Left is supposed to have more release than Right), and the make-up gain is also specific to each channel (so that you can have more Middle or Side).
